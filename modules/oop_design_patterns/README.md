OOP Design Patterns
=======================

http://drupal.org/project/oop_design_patterns

The project provides some useful Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Design Patterns implementations in the Drupal 8 environment.


Pattern demo available in this module:

OOP Design Pattern 1. Adapter/Wrapper.
Adapter/Wrapper is an OOP Structural Design Pattern meant to easy
application development in case some incompatible classes are used.
It implements a common Interface and requires an Adapter/Wrapper: a common
Interface implementation, for the each incompatible class.
Adapter/Wrapper logic is used to demonstrate a common payment interface
implementation for a set of different classes that, conventionally,
represents different Providers' payment interfaces.
